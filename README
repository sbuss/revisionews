RevisioNews will be a service that examines the dominant news sites for changes to articles that aren't declared.

The rise of digital media presents us with a problem - changes to published articles can be done secretly and with no accountability. There is no watchdog monitoring articles for changes, and we shouldn't trust the media to announce their changes.

RevisioNews aims to improve the integrity of journalists on the web by making unannounced changes known to the public.
